            The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy will be the ninth edition of the ICC Champions Trophy. It will be hosted by Pakistan and United Arab Emirates from 19 February to 9 March 2025 and will be contested by the top eight ranked men's national teams qualified from the 2023 Cricket World Cup. Pakistan are the defending champions, having won the previous edition in 2017.

            Background
            The ICC Champions Trophy is a quadrennial ODI cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Initially held as a biennial tournament since its inaugural edition in 1998 as ICC KnockOut Trophy, it was rebranded as ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 and has been held as a quadrennial tournament since 2009. In 2016, the ICC cancelled future editions of the Champions Trophy after the 2017 tournament, aiming to have only one major tournament in each format of international cricket.[1] However in November 2021 as part of the 2024-2031 ICC men's hosts cycle, ICC announced that the tournament would return from 2025 onwards.[2]

            Host selection
            Pakistan was announced as the host of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy on 16 November 2021 as part of the 2024-2031 ICC men's hosts cycle.[2] It will be the first global tournament to be hosted by Pakistan after 28 years,[3] since the 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team.[4] The last major tournament to take place in the country was the 1996 Cricket World Cup which it co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka.[5] United Arab Emirates was announced as a co-host due to India's refusal to play in Pakistan. Only the matches involving India will be played in UAE.[6][7]

            Format
            Eight qualified teams divided into two groups of four, will play against the three teams in their respective group – for a total of ten matches – and the top two teams in each group will advance to the knockout stage. The knockout stage will consist of 2 semi-finals and a final. A total of 15 matches will be played over 19 days.[6]

            India's participation
            Further information: India–Pakistan cricket rivalry and India–Pakistan relations
            The India–Pakistan cricket rivalry has been severely impacted by the tense political relations between the two nations. In November 2023, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) met with the ICC Executive Board to discuss compensation if India refused to play in Pakistan.[8][9] A year later, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) informed the ICC that India wouldn't travel to Pakistan for the tournament, citing security concerns.[10] Pakistan demanded a written explanation and initially rejected the proposed hybrid model.[11]

            Neutral venue arrangements
            On 19 December 2024, following an agreement between BCCI and PCB, the ICC in an update issued on India and Pakistan hosted matches at ICC events, established that the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy set to be played in February and March 2025 will be played across Pakistan and a neutral venue.[12][13] The ICC board confirmed that India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC events between 2024 and 2027 would be played at a neutral venue. This will apply also to the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup (hosted by India) and the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup (hosted by India and Sri Lanka). It was also announced that Pakistan had been awarded hosting rights of the 2028 Women's T20 World Cup, where neutral venue arrangements will also apply.[12] The fixtures were announced on 24 December 2024, along with the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai, UAE as the neutral venue for the tournament.[14][15]
